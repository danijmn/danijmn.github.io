                <p>
                    I, the developer, have NO access to any information that may personally identify anyone who plays Flip Grip or visits this website.
                    I do, however, integrate some third-party software, which in turn may collect some data from you.
                    Although this practice is quite commonplace, you have the right to know exactly what information is obtained,
                    the reasons why that information is collected and where you can learn more about that software.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Flip Grip uses a third-party service called “Unity Analytics” to obtain data about general gameplay events, such as when
                    you win or lose a level or reach a certain amount of game points. This data is collected in an anonymous, aggregated form, making it impossible
                    to identify any particular players from it. I can use the data, for example, to make adjustments to the levels that are statistically more difficult
                    to complete. You can read the privacy policy of “Unity Analytics” here: <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Periodically, Flip Grip may give you the opportunity to watch an advertisement in exchange for game points. This allows you to unlock new levels
                    more quickly, and helps me make some money. This feature is unobtrusive and can be completely ignored. The advertisements are served by a third-party
                    network called “Unity Ads”, which, for its own purposes, may collect some basic information.
                    You can read the privacy policy of “Unity Ads” here: <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>

                <p>
                    If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy or any other issues, please send an email
                    to <a href="mailto:support@danijmn.com"><span class="explicit-email">support@danijmn.com</span></a> and I will be glad to help you out.
